**@tinkoff/ng-event-filters** is a tiny (1KB gzip) library for
optimizing change detection cycles for performance sensitive events
(such as _touchmove_, _scroll_, _drag_ etc.) and declarative
_preventDefault()_ and _stopPropagation()_.

## How to use

1. Add new providers to your app module:

    ```typescript
    import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
    import {PLUGINS} from '@tinkoff/ng-event-filters'; // <-- THIS

    @NgModule({
        bootstrap: [
            /*...*/
        ],
        imports: [
            /*...*/
        ],
        declarations: [
            /*...*/
        ],
        providers: [...PLUGINS], // <-- GOES HERE
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

2. Use new modifiers for events in templates and in `@HostListener`:

    - `.stop` to call stopPropagation() on event
    - `.prevent` to call preventDefault() on event
    - `.silent` to call event handler outside Angular's `NgZone`

    For example:

    ```html
    <div (mousedown.prevent)="onMouseDown()">
        Clicking on this DIV will not move focus
    </div>
    ```

    ```html
    <div (click.stop)="onClick()">
        Clicks on this DIV will not bubble up
    </div>
    ```

    ```html
    <div (mousemove.silent)="onMouseMove()">
        Callbacks to mousemove will not trigger change detection
    </div>
    ```

3. You can also re-enter `NgZone` and trigger change detection, using `@filter` decorator:

```html
<div (scroll.silent)="onScroll($event.currentTarget)">
    Scrolling this DIV will only trigger change detection and onScroll callback if it is
    scrolled to bottom
</div>
```

```typescript
import {filter} from '@tinkoff/ng-event-filters';

export function scrollFilter(element: HTMLElement): boolean {
    return element.scrollTop === element.scrollHeight - element.clientHeight;
}

// ...

@filter(scrollFilter)
onScroll(_element: HTMLElement) {
    this.someService.requestMoreData();
}
```

> **All examples above work the same when used with `@HostListener`.**

## Important notes

-   Filter function will be called with the same arguments as the
    decorated method. Decorated method will be called and change detection
    triggered if filter function returns `true`.

-   Filter function must be exported named function for AOT, arrow
    functions will trigger build error.

-   `.silent` modifier will not work with built-in keyboard pseudo-events,
    such as `keydown.enter` or `keydown.arrowDown` since Angular re-enters `NgZone`
    inside internal handlers.
